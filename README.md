# ‚ö° Electrical Safety Reference Guide

This project provides essential information and best practices for electrical safety in the workplace, following the **OSHA Standard 1926.431**. Whether you're a safety officer, technician, or curious learner, this guide is designed to help prevent electrical hazards and foster a culture of safety.
# ‚ö° Electrical Safety Reference Web App

An interactive training platform designed to raise awareness and educate users on safe electrical practices in compliance with **OSHA Standard 1926.431**. The app visually presents key safety concepts, tips, and hazards through a dynamic poster-style interface.

## üß≠ Approach

This web app uses a poster-inspired design to make safety training engaging and intuitive. It leverages:

- **HTML/CSS** for a clean and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements (tooltips, pop-ups)
- **Safety-first UX** with bold icons, hazard alerts, and layered learning modules
